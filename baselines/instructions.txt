I created a new train and test file and also created the baseline_single_files.py file so it could work with these separate train and test files as input (instead of performing CV on one csv file). 

The test file is 3 times the size of the train file.

The train file contains 1666 sentences with only 2 templates, that are not returning in the test set:
- 835 sentences containing 'more specifically' (majority label by far is 0);
- 831 sentences containing 'but not' (majority label by far is 1);

The test file thus contains 4172 sentences with all other templates, that were not seen during training.


Instructions to run it:

-Move the new train and test file to the data directory:
$ mv data/subtask_1_en_test.csv ../../data/
$ mv data/subtask_1_en_train.csv ../../data/

- Run baseline_single_files.py from the  baselines directory as follows (since it currentlyonly works for english):
$ python baseline_single_files.py -mse -l 'en'
